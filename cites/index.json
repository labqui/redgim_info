    "abstract": "The detection and quantification of trace amounts of illicit substances such as crack-cocaine continues to be important for law enforcement and clinical medicine. Conventional methods available for crack-cocaine and adulterant detection include chromatography and presumptive testing. Here{,} we report a simple and inexpensive approach that employs a cell phone which images of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates were acquired to directly quantify cocaine and phenacetin in illicit samples seized in Brazil from 2012. Integration of a mobile application with a cell phone enabled immediate processing of TLC results{,} which eliminated the need for a bulky and expensive spectrometer. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was built using the RGB image system from the TLC plates containing cocaine (0.50 to 16.00 mg mL−1) and phenacetin (0.00 to 14.00 mg mL−1) as adulterants{,} acquired from a cell phone camera. The RMSEP values obtained for cocaine and phenacetin models were{,} respectively{,} equal to 1.60 and 1.36 mg mL−1{,} and their precision was respectively equal to 6.22 and 7.14%. No statistical difference was observed at a confidence level of 95% for both analytes calculated by the proposed method and those found by the reference method using gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID){,} proving the reliability of the imaging method as an alternative approach for these assays."

    "abstract": "In this paper, a colorimetric method for the detection of milk adulterants using smartphone image analysis is reported. This is based on the reactions to detect hydrogen peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, and starch in milk, where a color variation is observed for each substance. The image analysis was performed by using lab-made apps (PhotoMetrix®, and RedGIM®) based on partial least squares regression with the histograms of the red-green-blue images. The image histograms are automatically calculated using the smartphone camera and processed within the app. The results have shown the capability of this method to predict the concentration of the three adulterants, demonstrating the potential of the use of digital images and smartphone applications associated with chemometric tools. This method presents a fast, low-cost, and portable way to quantify adulterants in Cow milk."

    "abstract": "The study of the spectrum of light has increased its range of action in the field of chemistry, with the help of several advanced equipment and innovative techniques that have become a strong ally of analytical chemistry. However, the simplicity of obtaining results integrated with mobile devices appears as an interesting path to be taken in the field of chemical analysis. This work addresses the dissemination of an application called REDGIM for smartphones on the Android platform capable of working with multivariate image analysis using chemometric methods through the luminous intensities of photos and R (red), G (green) and B (blue) channels. In order to show the potential of REDGIM, we propose two applications using the partial least squares (PLS) regression method: 1) quantification of free chlorine in tap water; and 2) quantification of cannabinol, (CBN, a type of cannabinoid) in marijuana and hashish samples. The free chlorine concentration obtained for two investigated samples was 0.73 and 0.74 mg L–1 and 0.74 and 0.76 mg L–1 by the spectrophotometer and by the application (container: cuvette), respectively. For the quantification of CBN in marijuana and hashish samples, the mean concentration ranged from 6.137 to 8.823 mg mL–1. The results obtained by the application are compatible with results from traditional techniques, such as UV-Vis spectrophotometry, for example. Therefore, REDGIM was proved to be a simple and accessible technological tool for the scientific community, being viable for chemical tests of a multivariate nature."
